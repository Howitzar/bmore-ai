# bmore-ai

Trying to make BMO irl, meaning the code for the AI should be as BMO-like as possible, and interactive as the environment as possible. I am a complete novice in coding so this project will probably be highly ambitious, though I hope one day I'll complete it.

Here is a basic overview of what I'd want from BMO's script:

 **Boot and Initialization Script**
   - **Purpose**: To start up BMO's system and load essential modules.
   - **Components**:
     - Hardware checks (screen, buttons, memory, etc.).
     - Loading of core OS modules.
     - Activation of sensors (cameras, microphones).
     - Initialization of default state (e.g., waiting for interaction).

 **Interaction and Response Module**
   - **Purpose**: To allow BMO to interact with users and the environment.
   - **Components**:
     - Speech recognition system to understand spoken commands.
     - Gesture recognition (from its screen or camera).
     - Command processing logic to determine appropriate responses or actions.
     - Emotional state determination based on user interaction.

 **Gaming Engine**
   - **Purpose**: To run and manage the various games BMO can play.
   - **Components**:
     - Game loader to load game data from memory or cartridges.
     - Game state manager to save and resume game states.
     - Input processor to interpret user inputs during gameplay.

 **Emotion Simulation Module**
   - **Purpose**: To allow BMO to express and simulate human-like emotions.
   - **Components**:
     - Emotional state machine with states like happiness, sadness, curiosity, etc.
     - Behavior scripts associated with each emotional state (e.g., how BMO behaves when happy vs. sad).
     - Input analyzer to determine emotional shifts based on interactions.

 **Multimedia Processing Suite**
   - **Purpose**: To capture, store, and display images, videos, and music.
   - **Components**:
     - Camera and microphone data processors.
     - Multimedia storage and retrieval systems.
     - Playback systems for audio and video.

 **Self-preservation and Maintenance Scripts**
   - **Purpose**: To ensure BMO's longevity and repair minor software glitches.
   - **Components**:
     - Battery monitoring and energy conservation logic.
     - Error detection and self-repair routines.
     - System updates and patching routines.

 **Memory and Storage Management**
   - **Purpose**: To store and retrieve data, memories, games, etc.
   - **Components**:
     - File management system.
     - Data retrieval and storage algorithms.
     - Memory optimization and garbage collection routines.

 **External Connectivity and Communication Module**
   - **Purpose**: To allow BMO to connect with other devices or networks.
   - **Components**:
     - Wireless and wired communication protocols.
     - Data exchange routines.
     - Device pairing and authentication systems.

 **Personality Core**
   - **Purpose**: To give BMO its unique personality and quirks.
   - **Components**:
     - Personality traits definitions (e.g., BMO's love for singing, gaming, cooking and adventures).
     - Behavior decision trees that factor in BMO's personality.
     - Random behavior generators for unpredictability.

 **Security Protocols**
    - **Purpose**: To protect BMO from malicious threats.
    - **Components**:
      - Intrusion detection systems.
      - Data encryption and decryption routines.
      - Authentication protocols for user interactions.

I have attatched what the script I currently have for the BMO AI here, it utilises a script from a coder with a youtube channel called "Orbian" with his own BMO companion. The script has been changed and adapted to work on my windows laptop.
